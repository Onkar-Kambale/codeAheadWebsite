# codeAheadWebsite

To run a Python website built with Flask and Vanilla JavaScript, first set up your project directory with static (for JS, CSS) and templates (for HTML) folders
along with your app.py file. Create a virtual environment (python -m venv venv), activate it, and install Flask (pip install flask).
In app.py, define routes using Flask to serve the HTML and create APIs.
Write your frontend in index.html and scripts.js, linking them properly.
To start the server, run python app.py and open http://localhost:5000 in your browser.
You can deploy your project on platforms like Render, Vercel, or Railway for broader access.
